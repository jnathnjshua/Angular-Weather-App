# WeatherApp

This weather app helped me to better understand the Angular Web Framework and CLI. It utilizes the Current and Forecast REST API from www.weatherapi.com, allowing for the user to search the name of a city and get back the current temperature, minimum temperature for the day, maximum temperature for the day, humidity and current wind speed displayed in the Imperial system. The background image of the current temperature also changes based on whether the temperature is above or below 59Â°F.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
